# Safeboda technical challenge


## Introduction

[umbrella](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/dependencies-and-umbrella-projects.html)

## Challenge

### Description

SafeBoda want to give out promo codes worth x amount during events so people can
get free rides to and from the event. The flaw with that is people can use the
promo codes without going for the event.

### Features

* Generation of new promo codes for events
* The promo code is worth a specific amount of ride
* The promo code can expire
* Can be deactivated
* Return active promo codes
* Return all promo codes
* Only valid when userâ€™s pickup or destination is within x radius of the event venue
* The promo code radius should be configurable
* To test the validity of the promo code, expose an endpoint that accept origin, destination, the promo code. The api should return the promo code details and a polyline using the destination and origin if promo code is valid and an error otherwise.
